ESO AutoWayshrineConfirm addon
Auto Wayshrine Confirm
======================

Automatically accepts wayshrine fast travel confirmation dialogs when traveling between wayshrines (free travel).

FEATURES
--------
- Instantly teleports when using wayshrine-to-wayshrine travel (free)
- Does NOT auto-confirm paid travel from map (prevents accidental gold spending)
- No confirmation dialog needed for free wayshrine jumps
- Works with all wayshrines across Tamriel
- Zero configuration needed - just install and play
- Lightweight - no performance impact

HOW IT WORKS
------------
FREE TRAVEL (Auto-confirms):
When you're at a wayshrine and click another wayshrine to fast travel (free), 
the addon automatically confirms the travel dialog for you.

PAID TRAVEL (Normal dialog):
When you open the map from anywhere and click a wayshrine (costs gold), 
the normal confirmation dialog appears so you can decide whether to spend the gold.

This design prevents accidental gold spending while streamlining your free wayshrine travels!

INSTALLATION

1. Extract to your Elder Scrolls Online/live/AddOns folder
2. Restart game or /reloadui
3. That's it! No setup needed.
